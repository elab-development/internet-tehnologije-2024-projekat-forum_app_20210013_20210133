# NullPointer: A Community-Driven Q&A app.

A robust backend system for user management, question and answer handling, and a reputation-based voting system, built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT for authentication. The system includes features like user registration, login, password reset, reputation tracking, filtering and pagination.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Password Reset**: Users can reset their password via email using a secure token-based mechanism.
- **Reputation System**: Users earn reputation points through upvotes and downvotes on answers, as well as for posting questions.
- **Admin Privileges**: Admins can manage users, including banning and promoting them.
- **Pagination and Filtering**: API routes support pagination and filtering for users, questions and answers.
- **Security**: Uses JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends password reset emails to users.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Local or Cloud instance, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (Optional for testing APIs)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```
mkdir forum_app
cd forum_app
git clone https://github.com/elab-development/internet-tehnologije-2024-projekat-forum_app_20210013_20210133.git .
cd backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```
npm install
```

### 3. Setup environment variables

Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

```
PORT=port_number
FRONTEND_PORT=frontend_port_number
MONGO_URI=database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=jwt_secret_key
MAIL_PASS=password_for_email_service
```

| Variable        | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`          | Port on which the server will run.                                            |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Port on which the frontend service runs.                                      |
| `MONGO_URI`     | Connection string for your MongoDB instance.                                  |
| `JWT_SECRET`    | A secret key used for signing JWT tokens.                                     |
| `MAIL_PASS`     | The password for your email service (used for sending password reset emails). |

For the email service, you should use Gmail (check email configuration for "Less Secure Apps" or use App Passwords).

### 4. Run the Project

To start the application, make sure you are in the backend directory, then run:

```
npm start
```

The server will start on the port defined in the .env file.
